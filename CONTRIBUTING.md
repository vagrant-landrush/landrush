# Contributing to Landrush

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Landrush.
These are just guidelines, please use your best judgment and feel free
to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

At this point, this document is not complete, but as decisions are made
they will be added to this document.

## Pull Requests

* All changes should be made by pull request (PR), even from maintainers. 
* All changes should include documentation updates.
* Small changes need only 1 ACK.  Larger changes need 2 ACKs from
  maintainers before they will be merged. If the author of the PR is a
  maintainer, the submission is considered 1 of the 2 ACKs. Therefore PRs
  from maintainers only require one additional ACK. By "2 ACKs" we mean
  that 2 maintainers must acknowledge that the change is a good one. The
  2nd person to ACK the PR should merge the PR with a comment including
  their agreement.  We default to moving forward and using revert if needed.

## Merging PRs

1. Merging committer should first merge the PR
2. Merging committer should update the changelog in the unreleased
   section.  Using the github web UI is sufficient
